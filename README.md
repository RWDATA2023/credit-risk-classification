Credit Risk Classification: A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction:

What is Credit Risk?
Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Financial institutions, such as banks and lending companies, face this risk and must manage it effectively to ensure profitability.

Objective of This Project
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. We use logistic regression algorithms and data from a peer-to-peer lending service to train our model.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries Used:
NumPy: For numerical operations
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks
imbalanced-learn (imblearn): For handling class imbalance
Installation
To install the necessary libraries, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

Data Analysis and Model Building
Data Preparation
We start by importing a dataset of historical lending activity and preparing it for analysis. This involves:

Reading the data into a Pandas DataFrame
Cleaning the data to handle missing or irrelevant information
Splitting the data into "features" and "labels"
Model Training and Testing
We utilize two variations of the logistic regression model:

Standard Model: Using the original, imbalanced data
Oversampled Model: Using oversampled data to balance the classes
Both models are then trained on a training dataset and tested on a separate testing dataset.

Key Performance Metrics
We evaluate the performance of our models using three key metrics:

Standard Model:
Accuracy: 99%
Precision: Healthy Loans (1.00), High-Risk Loans (0.85)
Recall: Healthy Loans (1.00), High-Risk Loans (0.91)
Oversampled Model:
Accuracy: 99.4%
Precision: Healthy Loans (1.00), High-Risk Loans (0.84)
Recall: Healthy Loans (0.99), High-Risk Loans (0.99)
Conclusion and Recommendations
Summary of Findings
Both models show excellent accuracy in predicting loan risk. However, the Oversampled Model offers a slightly higher recall rate for high-risk loans, which is crucial for minimizing financial risk.

Recommendation
Given the critical importance of accurately identifying high-risk loans, we strongly recommend the use of the Oversampled Model for this task.
